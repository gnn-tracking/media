This repository hosts media files (videos, plots) related to the GNN Tracking project.
For the main code, see [gnn_tracking](https://github.com/gnn-tracking/gnn_tracking).

For example, here's an animation of how the object condensation latent space evolves during training (simplified example):

A random selection of particles has been selected and colored. At the end of the training, hits that belong to the same particle are indeed clustered together.
